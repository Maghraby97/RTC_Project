# RTC_Project
This is a Real_Time_Clock project based on PIC18F4620 microcontroller. 
This project is just a simple real time clock implementation using the help of the Timer0 peripheral. 
Quick brief about project: 
  -Timer0 issues an interrupt every 1 second. With simple logic inside the Interrupt service routine , I kept track of seconds , minutes and hours. 
  -Keypad is used to add some functionality to the project like (Resetting the clock , Setting the clock to a specific time). 
  -LCD is used in this project to guide the user in how to use the clock.
